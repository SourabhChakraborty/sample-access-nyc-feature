# sample-access-nyc-feature

Cornell Tech's Rebooting NYC report (https://urban.tech.cornell.edu/rebooting-nyc/) has the following feature suggestion for Access NYC:

A frequent concern is that benefits-eligible New Yorkers lose their benefits because they need to renew their eligibility periodically, but are not aware of their renewal deadlines. Managing these renewals can be a burdensome task for someone involved in multiple City programs—just as any parent of multiple children knows that keeping track of permission slips and forms they need for school can be complex. Currently, ACCESS NYC does not keep track of what programs a New Yorker is enrolled in or what their status is. While some interagency data sharing can run afoul of federal and state restrictions, it should be possible to create a tool that does not share such information across agencies, but merely consolidates it in the users’ mobile phone through separate, privacy-protected queries. 

This repository includes a simplified implementation of this feature within a Model-View-Controller application; part of the implementation uses the inversion of control design pattern.
